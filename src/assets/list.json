      "article": "Staking is a method of verifying and securing transactions on proof of stake blockchains. It’s faster and more energy efficient than other methods such as proof of work. Plus, participants get rewarded for helping in the process. In exchange for delegating your crypto, you get rewarded with more assets from the network. To generate staking rewards on a Proof of Stake blockchain, a node has to designate a certain amount of tokens on the network as a stake (similar to a security deposit). The chance of that node being chosen to validate the next block is typically proportional to the number of tokens being staked. If the node successfully validates a block, it is awarded the staking reward, similar to a miner being rewarded in Proof of Work chains. Validators lose part of their stake if they approve a fraudulent transaction — this incentivizes them to only approve valid transactions."
